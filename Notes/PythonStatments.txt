For control flow we use some keywords:

1.if

    if some_condition:
       #execute some code

2.elif

    if some_condition:
       #execute some code
    elif some_other_condition:
        #do somethign different
    else:
       #dp something else some code

3.else

    if some_condition:
       #execute some code
    else:
       #dp something else some code


Loops:

The term iterable means you can "iterate" over the object.

1. for

    my_iterable = [1,2,3
    for item_name in my_iterable:
        print

2. while

    while some_boolean_condition:
        #do_something

break: Breaks out of the current closet enclosing loop
continue: Goes to the top of the closet enclosing loop
pass: does nothing at all


Useful Operators:
range(start range, end range, step size)
enumerate() -> returns tuples
zip(list1, list2) -> zips together 2 lists
min(mylist)
max(mylist)

Random Library :
1. Shuffle list
from random import shuffle
shuffle(mylist)

2. Get Random integer
from random import randint
randint(0,100)

List Comprehensions: Flatting of for loop

List comprehensions are unique way of quickly creating a list with Python.

mystring = "hello"
mylist = [letter for letter in mystring]

Result = ['h', 'e', 'l','l', 'o']
